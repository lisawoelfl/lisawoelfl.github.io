	<p>As great as it is to travel the world to experience new street food, sometimes the best inspiration is right in
		your own backyard. Here in the United States, we have some of the most delicious corn growing through a decent
		chunk of the year, and we love to showcase it on our menus when it's at its peak. Blanching and then grilling
		the corn is the perfect way to prep it for this zesty Israeli interpretation that shows up on our menu in warm
		weather. Instead of slathering it with butter, we're recommending some spicy Israeli zhoug—an incredibly
		flavorful Middle Eastern green sauce with a texture between pesto and classic Mexican salsa verde. If you are
		missing a little extra fat, try mixing the zhoug with some vegan butter.
