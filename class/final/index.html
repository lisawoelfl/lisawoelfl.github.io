						When Kelsey Cassone's client needed clothes, she put together a bag and dropped it off on her
						doorsteps. "I hoped she liked what I picked out," Cassone says. At the beginning of the
						pandemic, she was still working as a case manager at TurnAround, an organization that serves
						survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence in Baltimore.</p>
					<p>
						TurnAround's offices closed for a year when Covid-19 hit. Clients lost access to the food
						pantry, free toiletries and clothes, the community kitchen and computers. "We did have a
						community of regulars," Cassone says. "We had clients who would come in daily because they
						needed to get out." With their safe space had to shut down, some felt isolated at a time that
						left victims of intimate partner violence especially vulnerable.

						The 24-hour hotline kept running when the city shut down. "At first our calls were lower, but
						then we saw a spike," says Cassone, TurnAround's senior data coordinator.</p>
					<p>
						The staff started regularly tracking calls to the hotline in March 2020. Ever since then, the
						trend shows an increase in calls. According to Cassone, demand for shelter was especially high
						during the beginning of the pandemic.

							href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8652464/#capp12564-bib-0039"
							target="_blank"> One study examined</a> calls to the police and to emergency hotlines in
						seven cities, including Baltimore. The researchers found that both types of calls increased in
						Baltimore, although the police's and emergency hotline's experiences were "dramatically
						different", researcher Tara Richards says.
					</p>
					<p>
						In March, calls to the police <a
							href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8652464/figure/capp12564-fig-0003/"
							target="_blank">much higher than expected </a>before returning to the usual call volume in
						May. The emergency hotline only registered a minor increase. By November, calls to the emergency
						hotline returned to normal levels, while calls to the police increased sharply from May through
						November.
					</p>
					<p>
						The data is not without limitations. As the study authors explain, surveys suggest that less
						than half of all incidents related to domestic violence are reported.

						Cassone cites stress and fear as factors that can heighten abuse. "Anything that can trigger
						stress and anger can trigger violence," she says. Loss of income and staying inside for long
						periods of time during the stay-at-home orders contribute to these risk factors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dororthy Lennig, who runs the legal clinic at House of Ruth, one of the biggest providers in the
						state, agrees. Her colleagues working the 24-hour hotline and the shelter saw an increase in
						cries for help. "That didn't happen at legal," Lennig says. One of the most important services
						in the legal clinic is helping victims of domestic violence obtain protective orders against
						their abusers. Their offices are situated at the courthouses around Maryland.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Word on the street was that the courts were closed," Lennig says about the early days of the
						pandemic, even though the legal clinic was still operating. "A lot of people thought you
						couldn't access our services. That was a problem." Additionally, there was really nowhere for
						victims to go, Lennig says. At times, the House of Ruth emergency shelter was at capacity.
						Friends and family members might have hesitated to take in survivors, worrying about
						transmission.

						In the city of Baltimore, the number of protective order issued dropped to just 22 cases in
						April 2020. Figures stayed low through May and spiked in June, when a record number of over 600
						protective orders were issued. After June, the number stabilized.
					</p>
					<p>
						"It was really the most horrible cases," Lennig says of those who turned to the legal clinic in
						the early months of the pandemic. "The abuse was so much worse than the average abuse that we
						see." The numbers of protective orders still haven't reached pre-pandemic levels, according to
						Lennig.
