## Introduction 

In this notebook, I'm examining call data from the Houston police department. The data spans from beginning of 2017 to end of 2022. The data is prefiltered for family violence related calls, although other calls are in the dataset as well.

I'm examining the data on family violence around Hurricane Harvey (Aug. 17 -  Sept. 3 2017) and Winter Storm Uri (Feb. 13 - 17 2021).

About Harvey: The hurricane hit Harvey starting Aug. 25, set a record of daily rainfall accumulations on Aug. 26 and 27. An estimated 30% of Harris County was flooded. 100 people died, at least 22 in Houston.
